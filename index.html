          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>
            My journey in Web development begins way back in Junior Secondary
            after I finished junior WAEC. I went to an academy where I learnt
            how to make webpages using HTML. It was from there that I developed
            an interest in web development, until I lost the book where I write
            my code, and my interest for web development went with it. My
            interest for it came back during my 2nd year in university after my
            friend wanted me to join him on a project he was working on. I
            realized later that there was more to web development than just
            HTML. So I relearnt HTML and proceeded to learn CSS. But after my
            day got so busy (school and my game dev) and because web dev was not
            my priority at that time, I decided to leave it. During my fourth
            year, when I was supposed to go for my IT. I had no idea what I
            wanted to learn, seeing as my school won't regard game development
            as something that can solve a problem. I decided to learn software
            development as games are technically a form of software. I then
            chose to go to Tenece Professional Services where I am currently
            working as a backend development intern. It was from there that I
            was introduced to Genesys Upskill and here I am now. My goal is to
            perfect frontend development through learnable then I can become a
            certified fullstack web developer.

          <aside>
            Fun Fact: Web development is somewhat like software development as
            it also comprises as frontend and backend development
          </aside>

          <h3>Reason for joining web developmet... again</h3>
          <p>
            Now I know some of you all maybe asking; After the number of times I
            dived into web development, why did I bother coming back? Well I
            would say because my mindset has changed since then. I rejoined web
            development because I want something to add to my portfolio. I also
            never want anything I find myself doing or learning to ever go to
            waste and I want to be the very best I can be.
